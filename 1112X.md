### Discuss:
#### Engine System
- Torque sensor shaft and housing assembly
  - This assembly transmits engine power to the nose gearbox from the No 1 and 3 engines and to the main gearbox from the No. 2 engine. The shaft assembly, consisting of a shaft and sleeve, is used for torque measuring purposes.
- Compressor section
  - Consists of a 14 stage compressor rotor assembly and the compressor stator assembly. The compressor rotor assembly is driven by a direct coupling to the gas generator turbine, and the compressor stator assembly contains inlet guide vanes and 13 stages of stator vanes. The inlet guide vanes and the first four stages of stator vanes are variable and change their angular position to permit efficient operation throughout the entire speed range. The primary purpose is to compress air for combustion.
- Combustion section
  - The section includes a combustion chamber and frame, combustion liner, exit guide vanes, and the combustion air deflector. The combustion chamber contains twelve fuel nozzles to provide fuel to the compressed air and two ignitor plugs to ignite the chrage during engine starts. The combustion liner consists of inner and outer shells perforated by louvers and thimble hole spaces to provide the airflow required for liner cooling, combustion, and dilution of combustion products to maintain required engine temperatures.
- Turbine section
  - Contains gas generator and power turbines. Both rotate counterclockwise but are not mechanically linked. The gas generator turbine rotor receives hot combustion chamber gases, decreases their velocity, and extracts the power necessary to drive the compressor. The remainder of the power generated by the combustion is used to drive the power turbine. The power turbine rotor contains a shaft that extends coaxially through the engine to provide power output. Power turbine speed may be maintained, or regulated independent of output power, when operating within the normal operating range. This principle provides more rapid acceleration because of the availability of high engine torque at low output speeds. The free power turbine principle allows the pilot to set a desired power turbine speed (Nf) with the engine speed control lever. The Nf governor will set the gas generator speed (Ng) at a level necessary to maintain the selected Nf and provide constant rotor rpm (Nr). Ng is primarily dependent upon fuel flow and is monitored by the engine fuel control. Ng is monitored to control acceleration and decelleration characteristics, prevent overspeed, and establish a minimum idle setting. Nf is dependent on engine speed control lever position and is monitored to regulate fuel flow to maintain an essentially constant speed for a given engine speed control lever position.
  - 100% Nf = 14,280 RPM
- Compartment cooling
  - In the 1 and 3 nacells, and the No. 2 engine compartment, an exhaust ejector is used to draw cooling air through the compartment, and out through the tailpipe. In this configuration, the tailpipe is not mounted directly to the rear of the engine. Instead, a gap between the engine exit and the tailpipe allows air from the compartment to flow through the tailpipe. This creates low pressure in the tailpipe and draws the compartment cooling air flow through the ejector gap and out the tailpipe.
- EAPS
  - Removes visible moisture, sand, dust, and other foreign particles entrained in the engine inlet air, scavenges and exhausts the foreign particles overboard, and allows clean air to enter the engine.
  - Closing EAPS doors can help prevent ice ingestion.
  - Switch can be in closed, open, or automatic. When closed, the doors are closed and the scavenge blower is on. When open, the doors are open and the blower is off.
  - In automatic, the doors will close below 78-88 KIAS and automatically open above this airspeed.
  - The EAPS DOOR CLOSED advisory light goes on when all doors are closed, it will turn off if any door is open.
  - There are two redundant pressure switches to sense airspeed from the pitot-static system. This allows the automatic opening and closing of the doors.
  - Each EAPS Separator panel contains 759 STRATA-TUBES. These tubes use cyclonic motion to cause foreign particles to migrate toward the walls of the tubes and pass into the scavenge ducting. From here, the blower exhausts the particles overboard.
  - The scavenge blower operates when the door is closed and transmission oil pressure is >14 psi.
  - Each EAPS has a secondary pressure switch to sense partial clogging across the separator panel.
    - Below 78-88 KIAS, the switch causes the EAPS HIGH PRES LOSS caution light to go on.
    - The light does not operate above this airspeed.
    - If in automatic mode below 78-88 KIAS and the EAPS HIGH PRES LOSS light comes on, the system will open the EAPS doors. The system will then sense normal pressure and close the door, causing the doors to cycle in this mode.
  - If both primary pressure switches fail in automatic mode, the secondary switch will open the door at 120 to 130 KIAS and cause the door to cycle. This is because the pressure switch will sense a pressure loss with the doors closed at 120-130 KIAS that is similar to a clogged EAPS.
  - Automatic control circuits are powered from the No. 1 primary DC bus.
  - Power is supplied to the No 1 and No 3 EAPS scavenge blowers by connecting to the same circuit as each engine anti-ice controller.
- Engine overspeed protection
  - An electrical system that will receive a signal from the transducer at the rear of the power turbine shaft. The overspeed switch will actuate at about 110 +/- 2% Nf. This will cause a solenoid in the fuel control to energize and reduce fuel flow to 75% Ng. The engine will then cycle until corrective action is taken.
  - The test switch does not control the circuit and only provide a test feature by actuating the fuel control solenoid to reduce Nf. The test will only energize after 95 +/-2% Nf  is reached.
  - Each system receives power from its respective DC bus.
- Fuel system
  - Consists of an engine-driven pump and filter system, engine FCU, flow divider, two stator vane actuators, and the fuel manifold and discharge nozzles.
  - Fuel is supplied from the fuel system to the filtration system and engine-driven pump, which passes the fuel to the engine FCU, where it is filtered and metered.
  - The flow is then passed to the divider, where it is filtered and directed to the discharge nozzles.
  - The fuel is first directed to the primary orifice, then at ~210 psi fuel is allowed to flow to the second orifice.
  - Each engine contains 12 dual fuel nozzles.
  - The fuel control unit senses seven inputs:
    1. Gas generator speed (Ng) via the engine accessory gearbox.
    2. Free power turbine speed (Nf) via the Nf flex cable from the nose gearboxes (main gearbox for #2 engine)
    3. Compressor discharge pressure (P3) which is a small amount of compressed air exiting the compressor, conducted via a metal tube to the fuel control, for management of flow.
    4. Compressor inlet temperature (T2) which is the temperature of air entering the engine compressor via the T2 bellows tubing mounted on the engine front frame section and the fuel control.
    5. Overspeed voltage from the overspeed switch mounted on the engine front frame section.
    6. Pilot input through positioning of the SCL for regulating Ng from shutoff to MAX GOV SCL. the SCL rotates the alpha shaft for engine starting, acceleration to ground idle Ng, transition to Nf governing range, and shutdown.
    7. Pilot input through positioning of the collective pitch lever which allows the FCU to anticipate rapid changes to output load. Movement of collective pitch rotates the fuel control beta shaft to reset Ng, compensating for load requirements of the Nf turbine.
  - The FCU outputs fuel to the engine and actuates the Variable Geometry actuators.
- Oil System
  - Each engine has an oil tank, dry sump, full scavenge oil system replenishied from the aux oil system.
  - Oil is gravity fed from the oil tank to the oil pump mounted on the rear face of the engine AGB.
  - The oil pump is a six element pump with all elements in tandem and driven on a common shaft. One element supplies oil to the engine and the other five elements scavenge the three engine oil sumps plus the accessory gearbox.
  - The oil pump distributes the oil under pressure through a filter to the accessory gears and engine bearings. Scavenge oil is used to heat the 6-o'clock frame strut, which aids in engine anti-ice. Oil from the scavenge elements is returned through an oil cooler to the oil tank.
  - Oil Tanks
    - Each tank contains
      - 1.32 Gal of usable oil
      - Space for 1.15 Gal of expansion
      - 0.10 Gal unusable oil
      - 1.45 Gal of dwell oil. (In order to avoid furnishing aerated oil to the engine)
  - Oil coolers
    - 1 and 3 are in the nose gearbox. Air is supplied by oil cooler blowers, mounted aft of the radiators and belt driven by the input shaft to the main gearbox.
    - 2 is mounted on the left of the main gearbox oil cooler.
    - Operation of oil cooler radiators is automatic
    - During cold engine starts, high oil pressures may be encountered until the oil has warmed. To hasten the warming of engine oil, oil bypasses the radiator until the oil has warmed, after which it is directed through the cores of the radiator, where it is cooled. The cooling air is exhausted into the helicopter slipstream.
  - Engine oil pressure lights
    - Each system has a high/low pressure switch that illuminates the appropriate light.
    - Low when 10 +/- 3 psi or below.
    - High when 100 +/- 3 or above.
    - When abnormal pressures are encountered, malfunction should be verified by other instrument cross-check. If flight permits, the engine should be shut down to prevent further damage.
    - The engine oil pressure lights are powered by the emergency DC bus.
  - Engine oil low level caution lights
    - Illuminate when associated tank is depleted by 25% of its fully serviced capacity and shall be replenished by the aux oil system. Receives power from each respective DC bus.
  - Engine chip Detectors
    - Chips are a sign of engine deterioration. Each engine has a chip detector in the engine accessory gearbox that will cause chip locator lights to come on.
    - The engine lubricating system routes lubricating oil past the magnetic chip detector, causing ferrous chips to be deposited on the detector. When there are enough chips to form a conductive bridge, an electrical circuit is completed and the chip detector light goes on. It is possible for conductive nonferrous material to pile up on the detector and cause the light to go on. The CHIP DETECTED light goes on simultaneously with the lighting of any chip locator light. The 1, 2, and 3 engine chip detectors operate their respective lights.
    - Power is provided through the emergency DC Bus.
  - Aux oil System
    - Consists of one tank, with hand pump, three tank full lights, three selector valves, and necessary plumbing for the system to replenish the oil in the engine oil tanks. Tanks are replenished by holding the appropriate valve open and actuating the hand pump until the appropriate tank full light comes on.
    - The tank has a capacity of 2.6 US gallons. It is equipped with a filler cap, drain valve, and necessary plumbing.
    - The pump is mounted on the cabin wall next to the tank and is manually operated by moving the handle.
    - The lights are above the tank and go on to indicate that the engine oil tanks have been replenished to a full level by the aux oil system. The lights thall not be used to determine when the engine oil tanks need servicing. They are powered by the no 3. Primary DC bus.
  - Engine speed control levers
    - Positions shut off, GRD IDLE, MIN GOV, and MAX GOV.
    - Shut OFF stopcocks the engines. Stopcock opens when an engine lever is **6.5 degrees** or more from SHUT OFF.
    - Ground idle Ng varies from 60.5 to 70% depending on OAT.
    - MAX GOV produces maximum Nf.
    - Accurate power changes and engine synchronization can be achieved with the engine trim switches.
    - A load signal shaft directly connected to the collective pitch lever by linkage, provides anticipation of load changes for reduction of transient droop; by resetting the fuel control governor proportional to the power required, it maintains rotor speed constant with changes in load.  Since the connection is mechanical and fixed, small changes in rotor speed can be experienced as ambient conditions change.
    - Maximum power available is indicated by lack of further increase in Ng, T5, and Nf when collective is increased. When at this condition, an increase in SCL will not provide an increase in power available.
    - The rotors must be engaged and the engine SCL at or above MIN GOV for the load signal shaft to be effective.
  - Engine speed trim switches
    - Used to make fine adjustments for engine synchronization.
    - Pilot overrides copilot.
    - Effective any time when increasing, can only decrease when SCL above MIN GOV.
    - Receive power from their respective DC buses through three circuit breakers.
  - Torquemeters
    - Two torquemeters are on the instrument panel, marked in torque percents with tape indicators for each engine. (100% is 3,200hp)
    - The OFF flag appears when electrical power is removed from the system.
    - The TOTAL window displays the average of the three engines.
    - The face is marked in 10% increments up to 160%.
    - The thickness of the numbered marks are equal to 2% torque.
    - The sensing system contains a shaft connected to the engine load and a reference sleeve. Both have teeth machined on their outside diameter. Engine load causes the teeth to displace from one another, which creates a phase angle difference that is converted to a proportional output voltage, which is read on the torquemeter as a percent torque. The emergency AC bus furnishes power.
  - Overtorque warning
    - Overtorque warning takes signals from the **copilot** triple torque indicator to illuminate the ENGINE OVERTORQUE caution light when the total engine torque is over 137%. The light is extinguished when torque falls below this value.
  - Nf/Nr tach
    - Two quad tape tachs are provided for each pilot. Three indicators are for the power turbine speed of the 1, 2, and 3 engines, the last is for the rotor speed.
    - An off flag indicates power removal.
    - Each is powered by its own tach-generator.
    - They are marked in units of 20 percent from 0 to 80, and 10 percent from 80 to 90, and 2 percent from 90 to 110 percent, then 10 percent from 110 to 130 percent.
    - A green RTR BK light on the panel goes on when Nr is between 50 +/- 4 and 25 +/- 4 percent. The emergency AC bus furnishes poewr through two CB.
  - Ng tachs  
    - Three Ng tachs are on the instrument panel, indicating gas generator speed in percent of total RPM. Each is powered by its own tach-generator on each engine accessory gearbox.
  - T5 gauge
    - Three inlet temperature indicators are on the instrument panel, marked in degrees celsius.
    - They operate from (14?) thermocouples in the turbine casing of each engine. The 1, 2, and 3 power turbine inlet temperature indicators are powered from the emergency AC bus.
  - Fuel flow indicators
    - Three fuel flow indicators calibrated in pounds per hour indicate fuel consumption of each engine individually.
  - Engine oil temperature gauges
    - Three oil temperature gauges are marked in Celsius degrees and indicate engine oil temperature sensed by a bulb on the **engine oil inlet line**
    - Each is powered by its DC bus.
    - N: The temp gauges should be constantly monitored when the engines are operating and the rotor is not turning, because the engine oil cooler blowers are not operating.

#### Engine Limitations
- Torque limits: No steady state combination of torque and speed shall exceed 160 percent torque at 100 percent Nf (5120 horsepower for T64-GE-416/416A/419).
- Ng is limited to 60.5 percent to 101.1 percent for normal operations. The maximum transient overspeed is 102.9 percent for 30 seconds.
- C: Military and maximum T5 temperatures are based on maximizing engine life expectancy. Exceeding these temperatures should be avoided consistent with operating requirements. T5 should not, however, be reduced for short periods of time and then returned to higher temperatures.
- OEI Contingency power.
  - The 419 engine has a one-engine inoperative contingency rating of 5000 shp at 100% Nf (157% torque) on a 32C day at sea level conditions for two minutes, followed by one hour of operation at maximum continuous rated power. 419 engines may reach as high as 105 percent Ng and 925C during OEI operations. This contingency power shall only be used in the event of an OEI situation.
  -C: Use of contingency power exceeds normal operating limits and requires completion of a MAF specifying the exceeded parameters and duration thereof.
  -N: 419 engines are adjusted to maximum topping provide for contingency power in the event of an engine failure. Large or rapid collective inputs may cause transient excursions into the contingency power range during three-engine operation. Exceeding the transmission limits shown in Figure 4-2 will reduce component life and require maintenance action.
- If Ng of 101.1-102.9% for 30 seconds is exceeded, the engine will require an overhaul.  The engine will also require an overhaul any time 102.9% is exceeded.
- If Nf overspeed of 125% for 5 seconds is exceeded, the engine will require an overhaul. The engine will also require an overhaul any time 129% is exceeded for any time period.

#### Engine Overspeed/Nf Flex Shaft Failure:
Symptoms: Fuel malfunction or Nf flex shaft failure
- All parameters increasing, fuel flow may jump to 1,700lbs or more.
N: Engine may accelerate to maximum power. If engine attempts to deliver uncommanded power exceeding the total torque requirements, Nf/Nr will increase/overspeed depending on the degree of power surplus. Also, if the engine attempts to deliver uncommanded power exceeding the total torque requirements, Nf/Nr can be expected to increase slightly, about 1% to 2%.
- Normal engines: All parameters decreasing except Nf, which will remain the same or possibly increase with affected engine.
1. *Collective - Maintain Nr
2. *Airspeed - As required.
3. *Pickle - External load as required.
4. *Tanks - Jettison as required.
5. *Speed control levers - As required. Attempt to regain control of affected engine power by retarding affected engine speed control lever below MIN GOV.
W: If the No. 2 engine speed control lever is at or below MIN GOV and the Ng is less than 75%, hot exhaust gas may backflow into the engine compartment, creating a fire hazard. Limit airspeed to less than 85 KIAS to reduce backflow. If dual-engine flight can be maintained, consideration should be given to securing the No. 2 engine.
6. If affected engine cannot be controlled manually without exceeding operating limits, secure engine as instructed under Engine Shutdown in Flight.
7. if Speed Control lever can be used to control affected engine power without exceeding operating limitations, use it to match engine torques. Make all collective adjustments slowly to facilitate maintaining torques matched.
N: Following an Nf flex shaft failure, the speed control lever will act as a direct throttle in the transition range, providing full control of engine power. Control may or may not be regained with a fuel control malfunction.
8. Make a normal landing in accordance with normal procedures, except copilot will do as follows, as directed by the pilot.
  - Control Nr throughout descent and approach by adjusting speed control lever of malfunctioning engine.
  - While reducing collective on landing, retard speed control lever on malfunctioning engine to prevent rotor overspeed.
For power train failure, see power train failure EP.

#### Compressor Stall
- Symptoms: Affected engine T5 increase, all other parameters decrease. As long as the affected engine is producing any usable torque, Nf will remain matched with the normal Nf/Nr. If torque drops to zero, Nf will likely split off and decay.
Normal engine parameters all increase except for steady Nf/Nr.
- N: Compressor stall is normally accompanied by unusual engine sounds/slight yaw kick. Illumination of ENGINE FUEL BOOST and FUEL FILTER CAUTION lights is possible due to decay of Ng.
1. *Collective - Maintain Nr.
2. *Airspeed - As required.
3. *Pickle - External load as required.
4. *Tanks - Jettison as required.
5. *Speed control levers - As required. (If compressor stall of No. 2 eng is indicated, immediately secure SCL and continue with engine shutdown in Flight procedures. If No 1 or No 3 engines, affected SCL below MIN GOV.)
- W: With a compressor stall in the No. 2 engine, any delay in shutdown of the engine can result in hot exhaust gas backflow into the engine compartment, creating a fire hazard.
6. If T5 continues to rise, position speed control of affected engine to SHUT OFF; secure engine as instructed under Engine Shut Down in Flight.
7. If T5 decreases and stall clears, slowly advance speed control lever to reestablish matched torques.
8. If stall recurs, secure affected engine as instructed under Engine Shutdown in Flight in this chapter.

#### Engine Power Loss
- Symptoms:
  - Power loss caused by control/accessory malfunction; no stall, no flameout. Under certain conditions, an Nf flex shaft failure will cause the affected engine to stabilize at ground idle with no control available through the speed control lever.
  - Affected engines: All engine parameters decreasing. As long as the engine is producing usable torque, Nf will remain matched with normal Nf/Nr. If torque drops to zero, Nf will likely split off and decay.
  - Normal engines: All engine parameters increasing except for steady Nf/Nr. If the normal engine power available is not sufficient for the affected engine power loss (eg torque requirement cannot be met) Nf/Nr may droop/decay excessively depending on the degree of power deficit. Also, if the normal engines have sufficient power available to compensate for the affected engine power loss, it is normal for Nf/Nr to droop about 1% to 2% as the normal engines are forced to assume the additional load.
  - Power loss caused by fuel contamination/fuel starvation (engine flameout)
  - Affected Engines: All parameters decreasing
  - Normal Engines: All engine parameters increasing except Nf/Nr. If the normal engine power available is not sufficient for the affected engine power loss (i.e. the total torque reqirement cannot be met), Nf/Nr may droop/decay excessively depending on the degree of power deficit. Also, if the normal engines have sufficient power available to compensate for the affected engine power loss (i.e. the total torque reqirement can be met) it is normal for Nf/Nr to droop about 1% to 2% as the normal engines are forced to assume the additional load.

1. *Collective - Maintain Nr.
2. *Airspeed - As required.
3. *Pickle - External load as required.
4. *Tanks - Jettison as required.
5. *Speed control levers - As required.
6. *Continue to use affected engine if engine is producing some torque and all engine parameters are within limits.

- W: If the No. 2 engine is operating at a low power condition and the Ng is less than 75%, hot exhaust gas may backflow into the engine compartment creating a fire hazard. Limit airspeed to less than 85 KIAS to reduce backflow. If dual-engine flight can be maintained, consideration should be given to securing the No. 2 engine.
8. Carefully monitor all engine parameters.
9. Secure affected engine as instructed under Engine Shutdown in Flight if any further engine malfunction is indicated, or if affected engine is not producing torque.
- N: If engine power loss takes place following fuel system transfer, selected fuel source is suspect for contamination or insufficient fuel.

#### Engine OIL PRESS HIGH caution light on
- Caused by cold oil or a plugged lube jet.
1. Maintain reduced speed/power on affected engine until engine oil temperature is within normal operating range.
2. If critical power requirements exist, reduce power of affected engine to minimum needed for immediate requirements.
3. Transition to single- or dual-engine operating procedures as quickly as possible, and secure affected engine as instructed under Engine Shutdown in Flight.

#### Engine OIL PRESS LOW caution light on
- N: Low pressure light may come on at ground idle if Ng is at or near the minimum limit.
1. If critical power requirements exist, reduce power of affected engine to minimum needed for immediate requirements.
2. Transition to single- or dual-engine operating procedures as quickly as possible, and secure affected engine as instructed under Engine Shutdown in Flight.

#### Engine High Oil Temperature
- N: Oil temperature may approach maximum limit during sustained high load condition at high ambient temperatures.
1. Reduce power of affected engine to minimum needed for immediate requirements.
2. If engine oil temperature decreases to within maximum limit, continue to operate affected engine at reduced power.
3. If engine oil temperature continues to exceed maximum operating limits, transition to single or dual-engine operating procedures as quickly as possible, and secure engine as instructed under Engine Shutdown in Flight.

#### Engine Lubrication System malfunction
- W: Level single- or dual-engine flight and/or safe single or dual-engine hover landing may not be possible at certain combinations of helicopter gross weight and density altitude. Flight conditions may require that the decision to establish single- or dual-engine flight be deferred until a safe descent is possible. Select landing site suitable for running landing if available.
- W: If the No. 2 engine must be operated at less than 75% Ng, hot exhaust gas may backflow into the engine compartment creating a fire hazard. Limit airspeed to less than 85 KIAS to reduce backflow. If dual-engine flight can be maintained, consideration shouldb e given to securing the No. 2 engine.

#### Engine chip Locator Light
- An engine chip locator light accompanied by unusual vibrations and/or low oil pressure/high oil temperature, or an engine chip locator light returning after resetting circuit breaker without the above indications, is cause to suspect possible engine failure. If an engine chip detector light goes on, do this:
1. *Instruments/Caution lights - Check.
- If secondary indications are present (vibrations/low oil pressure/high oil temperature)
2. *Perform Single or Dual Engine failure procedures.
- If the chip light is not accompanied by secondary indications:
3. *Pull and reset engine chip circuit breaker.
- If chip locator light returns after circuit breaker is reset:
4. Perform single or dual-engine failure procedures.
- If chip locator light remains off:
5. Continue mission, monitoring engine performance closely.
- W: Level single- or dual-engine flight and/or safe single- or dual-engine hover landings may not be possible at certain combinations of helicopter gross weight and density altitude. Flight conditions may require that the decision to establish single- or dual-engine flight be deferred until a safe descent is possible. Select landing site suitable for running landing if available.

#### Control Linkage Failure
Symptoms:
- Failure between power turbine and nose gearbox
  - Affected engines:
    - Sudden decrease to zero on Nf and torque indicators.
    - Ng and T5 increasing until overspeed system actuation, then T5 decreasing and Ng decreasing to flight idle.
    - Grinding/howling noise may be heard.
  - Normal Engines:
    - All engine parameters increasing except Nf/Nr. If the normal engine power available is not sufficient to offset the affected engine power loss (i.e. the total torque requirement cannot be met), Nf/Nr may droop or decay excessively, depending on the degree of power deficit. Also, if the normal engine power available is sufficient to offset the affected engine power loss (i.e. total torque requirement can be met), it is normal for Nf/Nr to droop about 1% to 2% as the normal engines are forced to assume the additional load.
- Failure in helicopter transmission system.
  - Affected engines:
    - Ng, T5 decrease
    - Nf - may increase to overspeed cut in (110% +/- 2%) then decrease with Ng stabilizing at flight idle speed.
    - Torque - Decrease to zero.
1. *Collective - Maintain Nr
2. *Airspeed - As required.
3. *Pickle - External load as required.
4. *Tanks - Jettison as required.
5. *Speed control levers - As required (secure engines)
- W/C: Do not attempt to restart affected engine.

#### Effects of gross weight on single and/or dual engine performance

#### Engine shutdown in flight/fuel siphoning
1. *Speed control lever - Shut off. If No. 2 engine is being secured, reduce airspeed to less than 85 KIAS.
- W: If an operating engine and a failed or secured engine have the same tank selected, the operating engine may flame out if the failed or secured engine fuel selector lever was not placed to SHUT OFF.
- W: Failure to reduce airspeed below 85 KIAS when securing the No. 2 engine increases the hot exhaust backflow component and likelihood of a subsequent engine compartment fire.
2. *Fuel selector lever - Shut off.
- C: If an engine postshutdown fire should occur, as indicated by a **continuous T5 above 320C**, motor engine with starter to extinguish fire.
3. Adjust power on operating engines.
4. EAPS door - Closed.

#### Engine restart in flight
- A failed engine should not be restored in flight unless it can be determined that it is reasonably safe to do so. A No. 2 engine in-flight restart should be determined by critical power requirements.
- W: Failure to reduce airspeed below 85 KIAS during the No. 2 engine start sequence increases the hot exhaust backflow component and likelihood of a subsequent engine compartment fire.
- C: If at least 30 seconds of gas generator windmilling with the speed control lever at SHUT-OFF is not provided, the possibility of a hot start increases due to fuel accumulation and excess fumes.
- N: The No. 2 ENGINE OVERHEAT caution light may illuminate for a short time (up to 30 seconds) during restart of the No. 2 engine at any airspeed.
- N: For aircraft with IR Flame Detectors, in addition to the No. 2 ENGINE OVERHEAT caution light, the FIRE warning light and No. 2 entine emergency T-Handle may illuminate for a short time (up to 30 seconds) during restar of the No. 2 engine at any airspeed.
1. Emergency start switch - EMER
2. EAPS - Closed.
3. Engine speed control lever - SHUT OFF. Inoperative engine.
4. Fuel selector lever - As Required.
- C: Due to probabiliy of damaging the starting system, if time permits, the gas generator speed should be at zero before engaging the starter.
5. Starter button - Press.
6. Speed control lever - GRD IDLE at 20 percent Ng.
7. Engine instruments - Checked.
- While engine is accelerating, check Ng tachometer, T5 indicator, and engine fuel flow, as during normal start. If a hot or hung start is experienced with the No. 2 engine, immediately secure engine.
8. Speed control lever - 100 percent Nf, match engine torques.
9. EAPS - As desired.


### Introduce:
#### Simulated single and/or dual engine failure at altitude
- Simulated engine-out flight is an intentional reduction of engine power to simulate loss of an engine in flight. It is intended to develop automatic, deliberate pilot reactions that would result in a safe landing in an actual emergency.
- Dual-engine failure shall never be simulated by reducing more than one speed control lever below 100% Nf. Dual engine failure will be simulated by calculating and announcing an artificial power available limit (2/3 HOGE Max power available). All simulated emergencies shall be treated as actual until announced as "simulated"
1. All NATOPS engine failure procedures shall be adhered to on all simulated engine failures.
2. Upon recognition of an engine producing significantly less torque than the other two (>10% difference) scan the quad tach for Nr (should be no lower than 100%), and announce an engine emergency to the crew over ICS.
3. The IP shall then announce "SIMULATED"
4. Execute the NATOPS emergency procedure, as appropriate, and to the extent briefed by the IP. SCL shall not be moved below MIN GOV in the execution of a SIMULATED procedure.
#### Running takeoffs
- Align the helicopter with the runway centerline and move the cyclic forward to put the tip-path plane no lower than the horizon. Smoothly increase collective to begin forward motion over the ground. Maintain heading with the pedals.
- The PNAC will read ground speeds from the GPS progress page in 5kt increments as soon as the aircraft is moving. Once the aircraft has accelerated through translational lift, smoothly move the cyclic aft while simultaneously increasing the collective to establish a shallow climb. The PAC will ensure the wheels are off the deck prior to 40 knots groundspeed.
c. Do not raise the nose any higher than the normal hover attitude (5 degrees nose up on the attitude gyro) to minimize the possibility of a tailskid strike on takeoff.
d. At 100' AGL and 60 kts, maneuver is complete. Transition to normal climb.
- Running Landing
- During the pre-landing checklist, set a simulated max power available. This can be the same setting used during the MGW running takeoff.
- Execute a normal approach to final. Arrive at the 90 at 200-250' AGL and 60-65 KIAS
- On final, PNAC should provide ground speed references.
- At less than 40 kts (and no lower than 30' AGL), transition to the landing attitude (no more than 8 degrees nose up). Adjust the collective to maintain a controlled rate of descent (100-200fpm) until touchdown.
- Maintain heading in line with the direction of travel with the pedals.
- As the main mounts touch down, adjust the cyclic to maintain a level attitude and slowly reduce the collective to lower the nose gear to the deck. Do not allow the nose to strike the deck.
- To slow and stop the aircraft, lower the collective full down and smoothly lower the TPP to slightly above the horizon. Do not lower the tip path until the collective is full down and the nose wheel is on the deck. This slows the aircraft to a speed (5-10 knots) where the wheel brakes can be employed without danger of a brake fire or tire blowout. Maintain heading with the pedals and stop with the brakes.
