#### BIM/IBIS blade Systems
- The in-flight blade inspection system (IBIS) consists of each main rotor blade spar being pressurized with nitrogen to about 10 psi at an ambient temperature of 18 to 24 C, a pressure indicator (with radioactive source) on the root of each spar, a radiation detector aft of the main rotor pylon area, a signal processor with a test panel in the cabin, and BIM caution light.
- For visual inspection the pressure indicator shows two white stripes indicating spar pressure is safe. If spar pressure **drops to 5 +/- 0.5psi or less** the pressure indicator will show two black stripes, indicating pressure is escaping through a crack in the spar or through a faulty seal. A pressure indicator with safe indications can be checked by pressing the manual test button on the indicator, causing the unsafe indication to be displayed. Once two black stripes are displayed, regardless of the cuase, the reset button, on the pressure indicator, has to be pressed to replace the black indication with a white indication, if spar pressure is normal. The test button is always pressed with the clear plastic shield over the indicator to prevent radiation escape.
- The pressure indicator contains a radioactive source that is shielded when the indicator is at the safe indication. When the indicator goes to the unsafe position the radioactive source moves out of the shielded postion and is exposed. As the rotating unsafe blade passes over the radiation detector the radioactive rays being released by the blade unsafe indicator are sensed by the radiation detector. this sends an electrical signal to the signal processor, that deenergizes a relay in the processor and causes the BIM caution light to go on.
- To be sure the detector is capable of detecting radiation, a small radioactive source, incorporated into the detector, continuously emits radiaiton at a lower rate than the spar pressure indicator. The detector continually senses its own radiation and sends a signal to the signal processor to energize a relay that extinguishes the BIM caution light. Therefore, the following will cause the BIM caution light to go on:
1. Loss of pressure in the spar
2. Failure of the radiation detector
3. Failure of the signal processor
4. Loss of 115VAC
- The No 3 primary AC and No 2 primary DC buses furnish power to the system through two circuit breakers in the cabin.
- The panel is on the signal processor in the center of the cabin on the right side.
The panel is used for Built-in-Test to verify operation of the radiation detector and the signal processor. The panel contains a BIT switch; a PRESS TO TEST pushbutton, a red WARN light, a green SAFE light, and a decal that gives the BIT procedure and the desired displays.
- Selecting DET with the BIT switch and presisng the PRESS-TO-TEST pushbutton simulates the detector normal sensing of its own low radiation rate and lights the green SAFE light. This is an operational checkout of the detector.
- Selecting LOW WARN and pressing the pushbutton simulates loss of the detector own low radiation rate and lights the BIM Caution light and red WARN light. This is a functional checkout of the signal processor.
- Selecting SAFE and pressing the pushbutton simulates the detector normal sensing of its own low radiation rate and lights the green safe light. This is a functional chekcout of the signal processor. The BIM caution light goes on for 8-12 seconds when the PRESS to TEST pushbutton is released.
- Selecting HIGH WARN and pressing the pushbutton simulates the detector sensing a high radiation rate form a spar pressure indicator with low pressure. the BIM caution light goes on for 8 to 12 seconds and the red WARN light comes on. This is a functional checkout of the signal processor.

#### BIM/Blade pressure caution light in Flight
- If BIM caution light goes on, have a crewmember check if BIM circuit breaker is in (on the right cabin circuit breaker panel). Due to the sensitivity of the system, the caution light may go on due to electromagnetic interference, giving the pilot a false indication of impending spar failure. If the caution light remains on with the circuit breaker in, and EMI is not verified:
- In Flight
1. *Airspeed - 80 KIAS, minimize maneuvering.
2. *Altitude - Min safe.
3. No. 3 pirmary AC BIM circuit breaker - Check in.
4. Land as soon as practical. Do not exceed 1.5 flight hours unless necessary to reach a safe landing site.
  - If flying with an external load that cannot be safely transported at 80 KIAS, consideration should be given to load jettison. Hover flight should be minimized.
- Flight operations outside a level cruise flight regime of 80 +/- 5 KIAS and operations in a hover produce blade flight loads that will increase potential crack stress and accelerate crack propagation rates. Continuous flight outside this recommended flight profile will compromise the safety margin incorporated into the maximum prescribed flight duration and lower the 1.5 hour interval.
- Aircrew
1. Pull and reset circuit breaker.
2. Perform IBIS BIT check.

#### Flight control system
- Pitch, roll, yaw, and vertical maneuvering of the helicopter is done with the pilot controls by tilting the tip path plane formed by the main rotor blades, and varying the thrust of the tail rotor. The helicopter is maneuvered by the cyclic in pitch and roll, and the rudder pedals in yaw, and by the collective vertically.
- Main rotor control system
  - The cyclic and collective are connected to the main rotor primary tandem servos by mechanical linkage. The linkage from these flight controls are connected first to the AFCS pitch, roll, and collective servos, which function as mechanical connections with AFCS off. To smooth out pilot roll inputs, a viscous damper is incorporated in the roll linkage between the cyclic and the AFCS roll servo. The damper permits limited continued flight with reduced damping if the damper fails. A failed damper will be indicated by lighter than normal lateral forces. The force felt with a faild damper is fixed and almost imperceptible, about 1 pound. A slight decrease in this force is felt at the cyclic as it passes over the detent.
  - C: If the roll damper fails, the flight shall be aborted.
  - To smooth out pilot pitch inputs, the FAS actuator also acts as a damper, with FAS on or off. The FAS actuator is just above the AFCS pitch servo. The actuator output piston is connected to the rod and shear pin assembly that extends through the pitch servo housing. The rod and shear pin connects the actuator output to the flight control linkage at the point where the cyclic linkage is attached to the servo input. The pitch, roll, and collective linkage continues on to the mixing unit where the necessary control couplings are made. In the pitch linkage between the AFCS pitch servo and the mixing unit, there is a longitudinal bias actuator that functions as a mechanical connection with AFCS off. Finally, the linkage goes to the forward, aft, and lateral main rotor primary servos.
  - These servos furnish the necessary hydraulic boost required to tilt, raise, and lower the stationary swashplate. In addition, the servos eliminate any feedback of the aerodynamic forces generated by the rotating main rotor. If the control linkage to a primary tandem servo fails, a self-centering spring cylinder assembly attached to the last control component before attachment to the primary tandem servo, sets that servo to an intermediate position to prevent a hardover. If a self-centering cylinder assembly jams the controls, a shear pin is incorporated in the support of the assembly that is sheared by the force of AFCS power boost. The pin is sheared by movement of the rudder pedals, cyclic, or collective. The stationary swashplate causes the pitch control rods to change the pitch angle of the main rotor blades, which subsequently tilts the tip path plane of the main rotor blades.
- Collective pitch
  - The collective operates simultaneously to change the collective pitch of the main rotor blades and change the tail rotor pitch. A collective viscous damper is installed on the copilot collective torque arm in the left electronics compartment. The collective grips contain switches to turn the first and second stage of the primary servos on and off, the collective trim release switches, pedal trim release switches, plus other switches to operate auxiliary equipment.
- Cyclic
  - The cyclic in front of the pilot seats operates simultaneously to provide pitch and roll control. Moving the cyclic in any direction tilts the tip path plane of the main rotor blades and moves the helicopter in the same direction. The cyclic grips contain the cyclic beeper trim buttons, the cyclic trim release buttons, plus other switches to operate auxiliary equipment.
- Tail rotor control system
  - This system compensates for main rotor torque and permits changing the heading of the helicopter. The torque developed by the main rotor blades rotating counterclockwise tends to turn the fuselage clockwise. Tail rotor control couplings are programmed to compensate for all main rotor variations. The rudder pedals are connected to the tail rotor tandem servo by mechanical linkage. The linkage is connected first to the AFCS yaw servo, that functions as a mechanical connection with AFCS hydraulic power off. To prevent overstressing the helicopter from too rapid movement of the rudder pedals, a damper is incorporated in the AFCS yaw servo that functions with AFCS on or off. The linkage continues on to the mixing unit, where control couplings are made. Finally, the linkage leads to the tail rotor tandem servo, that hydraulically assists control inputs. The servo extends and retracts the tail rotor actuator shaft, causing the pitch beam and pitch change links to vary the pitch of the tail rotor blades. A self-centering spring that is part of the tail rotor tandem servo will set the tail rotor pitch angle to a position that may permit continued flight to a landing site if the tail rotor control system fails and the tail rotor tandem servo is pressurized.
- Rudder pedals
  - The rudder pedals in front of each pilot operate simultaneously to change the pitch/thurst of the tail rotor and subsequently the heading of the helicopter. Footrests on the outboard side of each pedal prevent inadvertent actuation of the rudder pedal microswitches. The wheel brake power boost cylinders for the main landing gear are mounted on the rudder pedals.
  - The pedal adjustment allows the pilot to place the pedals in a comfortable position.

#### Control couplings
- The mixing unit makes these couplings: Collective to yaw, collective to pitch, collective to roll. Yaw to pitch, yaw to roll.
- These couplings provide automatic proportional transfer between the axes when the appropriate control is moved.
- Collective to yaw coupling
  - The collective to yaw coupling provides increased tail rotor thrust for collective increase. This transfer is irreversible, and combinations of collective pitch and rudder pedal motion that would exceed the tail rotor pitch limit cannot be realized. If the control positions are such that the left tail rotor pitch limit is reached, additional upward movement of the collective pitch lever is always possible. During this upward movement, the left rudder pedal will move aft, but the tail rotor pitch limit will still be realized. A yaw breakaway rod is incorporated into the yaw linkage aft of the mixing unit. Movement of the collective will shear a pin within the rod and permit continued control of the main rotor, if the tail rotor linkage jams. The pin is sheared by the mechanical advantage exerted through the collective channel. If the tail rotor linkage jams aft of the mixing unit, the force required to shear the shear pin is about 65 pounds with AFCS servo on and about 122 pounds with AFCS servo off.
- Collective to pitch coupling
  - The collective to pitch coupling provides longitudinal cyclic (pitch) inputs proportional to collective inputs to compensate for pitching movements produced by main rotor thrust changes.
- Collective to roll coupling
  - The collective to roll coupling provides lateral cyclic inputs proportional to collective control changes to compensate for tail rotor thrust produced roll moments caused by the collective to yaw coupling.
- Yaw to pitch coupling
  - The yaw to pitch coupling provides longitudinal cyclic inputs proportional to pedal inputs to compensate for the pitching moment produced by the vertical thrust component of the canted tail rotor.
- Yaw to roll coupling
  - The yaw to roll coupling provides lateral cyclic inputs proportional to pedal inputs to compensate for tail rotor thrust produced roll moments caused by directional control inputs.

#### Damper system/Failures
- When the rotor damper fails, an unbalanced rotor condition may be felt as a low-frequency beat or lateral vibration. Rotor blades will normally stay in track. If a rotor damper is suspected of failing, do this:
1. Make smooth and small control inputs.
2. Slowly increase main rotor rpm
3. Slowly reduce airspeed to 80 KIAS
4. Use small bank angles.
5. Land as soon as practical. If vibrations become excessive
6. Land as soon as possible.
- N: A shallow approach to a running landing is preferable. However, if conditions do not permit, then an approach to a touchdown (no hover) landing should be made.
7. After the helicopter has come to a stop, accomplish an engine shutdown without use of the rotor brake.
- W: A rotor damper failure could lead to ground resonance.
- Hydraulic dampers minimize the hunting movement of the blades about the vertical hinges as they rotate, prevent shock to the blades when the main rotor head assembly is started or stopped, and position the blades against the lag stops after rotor shutdown.
- To smooth out pilot roll inputs, a viscous damper is incorporated in the roll linkage between the cyclic and the AFCS roll servo. The damper permits limited continued flight with reduced damping if the damper fails. A failed damper will be indicated by lighter than normal lateral forces. The force felt with a failed damper is fixed and almost imperceptible, about 1 pound. A slight decrease in this force is felt at the cyclic as it passes over the detent.
- C: If the roll damper fails, the flight shall be aborted.

#### Primary tandem servo operation/malfunctions
- The primary visual indications of a primary tandem servo malfunction are the 1 STG M/R SERVO BYPASS or 2 STG M/R SERVO BYPASS caution lights that go on when a servo has malfunctioned in such a manner to cause it to bypass hydraulic pressure or it has lost system pressure.
- W: When the 1 STG M/R SERVO BYPASS caution light is observed after a utility hydraulic system failure, securing the first stage flight control system will result in loss of tail rotor control. There are no interlocks to prevent turning off pressure to the first or second stage hydraulic systems when a servo in the other stage is in bypass. turning off pressure to the nonbypassed stage results in the loss of control of the servo.
- An individual primary tandem servo malfunction will be indicated by a servo bypass caution light that indicates which flight control hydraulic system has the failed servo. The caution light does not indicate the individual servo that has failed. The servo bypasss caution light will indicate a servo has failed in a manner that has subjected it to a loss of hydraulic pressur.e The servo bypass caution light may go off with certain positions of the servo piston, even though the malfunction still exists. In this case, check the appropriate flight control hydraulic system pressure gauge to determine if the system has failed or the failure is within the servo.
- When a servo bypass caution light is observed, do not turn off the corresponding servo system unless there is a definite restriction of controls and do the following:
1. *Airspeed - Reduce.
2. *Land as soon as possible.

#### Approach and landing with a tail rotor control system malfunction
- If an approach and landing is to be made, airspeed can be reduced while maintaining a reasonable trimmed flight condition by slowly reducing power and entering a left turn with the cyclic. Balanced flight can be maintained during power and airspeed changes by increasing or decreasing the roll angle until about 35 to 40 percent torque and 50 to 60 KIAS is attained. Level flight can then be maintained with a small amount of right sideslip at 35 percent to 40 percent torque and 50 to 60 KIAS. Increasing collective too rapidly or too much will cuase a sideslip to the left and decreasing collective too rapidly or too much will cause a sideslip to the right. It is recommended that a roll-on landing be made on a prepared surface. If the landing has to be made to an unprepared surface, consideration should be given to a wheels-up slide-on landing. It is important during the final phase of the landing to
1. Retain attitude reference by referencing the VGI
2. Slightly apply collective just before touchdown to provide a nonslip condition for touchdown.
3. Immediately apply wheel brakes while slowly lowering the collective. A wave-off may be made any time before a small flare is initiated for the final touchdown by accelerating into forward flight. While accelerating, the helicopter will enter a left sideslip condition that will decrease as airspeed is increased.
1. Flightpath - 180 left approach.
2. Downwind leg - 200 feet altitude and 45 to 50 KIAS.
- N: Airspeed can be reduced during the turn on to final approach or when rolling out of the turn to final approach.
3. Start - App
- N: Nr above 103 percent may result in APP shutdown.
4. Final approach - 6 to 8 degrees nose up attitude, and enough torque to maintain 35 to 45 KIAS and 200 to 300 fpm rate of descent.
- W: Rapid or too large increased collective application will cause the helicopter to sideslip to the left. Rapid or too large decreased collective application will cause the helicopter to sideslip to the right.
5. Collective - Increase slightly to reduce sideslip and maintain all conditions on touchdown.
6. Touchdown - Immediately apply wheel brakes and slowly lower collective.
7. Speed control levers - GROUND IDLE.
- Three main rotor primary tandem servos are mounted on the main gearbox and are designated forward, lateral, and aft. The primary tandem servos furnish the power boos tot transmit control movements to the stationary swashplate of the main rotor head.
- Each primary tandem servo consists of two independent cylinder sections, which share a common housing, piston shaft, and input linkage. The top cylinder of each primary tandem servo is the second stage servo and the bottom cylinder is the first stage servo. Normally both work in unison. Either the first or second stage servos can provide control of the main rotor if the other servo is not operating. Each stage contains bypass valves interconnecting both sides of the respective power piston to each other and to return. This prevents hydraulic lock, by making the unit act as a pure mechanical linkage in the control system if a pilot valve or system malfunctions. All loads are then taken over by the alternate stage without incrase in control forces. The tail rotor tandem servo operates the same way. One stage is powered by first stage hydraulics and the other by utility hydraulics.

### Introduce

#### High AOB maneuvers
- Maintain airspeed at or below 130 KIAS. Do not exceed AOB limits.
  - GW <= 56,000lb DA <= 3000' A/S <= 130 KIAS: 60 degrees
  - GW <= 56,000lb DA > 3000' or GW <= 56,000lb and A/S > 130 KIAS: 45 degrees
  - GW > 56,000lb: 30 degrees
- From straight and level flight, smoothly roll into the desired angle of bank. Scan the horizon, direction of turn, and flight instruments.
- Maintain airspeed with cyclic and prevent the nose from falling through the horizon. Maintain altitude with collective, maintain balanced flight with appropriate pedal inputs.
- Upon reaching the desired AOB, adjust the cyclic to stop the roll, and stabilize all parameters.
- To roll out of the turn, apply cyclic in the opposite direction of the turn until wings level, and adjust collective to maintain level flight. Stabilize all parameters.

#### Practice Autorotative Flight
- At least 2000' AGL, 75 KIAS or 100 KIAS, 100% Nr straight and level (VSI 0)
- Smoothly lower collective to fully down, once down, slowly raise to set Nr at approx 100%.
- Set and trim nose attitude to maintain selected entry airspeed.
- Maintain Nr below 110% throughout the descent. Gradual airspeed changes may be conducted during the descent to demonstrate effect on rate of descent and rotor response. Avoid abrupt pitch attitude changes.
- The PNAC shall call out AGL altitudes in 100' increments down to 500' AGL, then 50' increments thereafter.
- Smoothly raise the collective to recover from the autorotative descent. During recovery, aircraft shall not descend below the most restrictive altitude dictated by the FAR part 91, MSA, local SOP, or current R&I.
- In a true autorotation, optimum rotor speed is 95 to 100%.
  - At or above 150' AGL initiate flare, 50-75' AGL rock and pull.
